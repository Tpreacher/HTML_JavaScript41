    <h2>My Bio</h2>

    <p>My name is Tau, I'm an avid gamer and and a fan of Star Wars who had a little too much money by the end of the summer. I've spent a lot of my life moving from place to place and even spent time outside of the country while I was much younger. My love for games started young playing educational games on cd to playing massive online community games like Poptropica, Club Penguins, and Moshi Monsters. I would say that as a kid I lost myself in games at one point neglecting social abilities and just having fun on my own, I learned that the two aren't independent and never should be. The happiness that I gained from finding friends who loved the same games as me was incredible and it was great when we learned from eachother and could each other out side of the games. This all didn't happen till the end of elementary when i had moved to yet another new place and tried making new friends once again.
    <p>In the new town I had the same old template of making new friends just with fresh new faces and a brand new building. I lived close to a group of kids and we would often walk home together do our homework and head over to our friends house and play the Wii, PlayStation, and Xbox and once we were bored of those we'd head out side and play</p>
